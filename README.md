## Why Choose P40?
The P40 is a graphics card with computing power close to that of the 1080, which is not particularly remarkable, but it has 24GB of memory, which is a level that is difficult for most consumer cards on the market to reach. Although the computing power itself may not keep up with the times, it is a highly recommended entry-level card for AI training and use due to its low price and cost-effective memory, which can support most AI models provided online.
